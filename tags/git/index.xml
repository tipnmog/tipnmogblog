      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I have been trying to force myself to learn and use Git.  Maybe the &amp;ldquo;force&amp;rdquo; myself is what has prevented me from being successful with the tool.  I want to learn Git because the concept intrigues me.  In my mind this is a very valid concept to maintain versions of the work I am doing on my local device and in a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have been going about this wrong.  I have chosen a direction that clearly does not work for me.  So far, every attempt I have made to use and be proficient has not been the correct path for me.  In the past I would start a programming project or related project and think, &amp;ldquo;I need to use Git to maintain versions and to learn the tool while working this project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
